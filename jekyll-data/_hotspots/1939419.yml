    description:    "Jean-Henri Riesener delivered this exquisite writing table to the Versailles apartment of Princess Élisabeth, the youngest sister of King Louis XVI, on December 31, 1785 (image 2).
​<br><br>
Riesener made numerous versions of the table, including another in the Museum’s collection—on view at the other end of this wall—that he created for Queen Marie Antoinette. Perhaps as a reflection of the cabinetmaker’s fondness for the model, a similar table appears in a portrait of him painted by Antoine Vestier in 1786 (image 3).
​​<br><br>
Small, portable tables proliferated in the 1700s, easily moved from one room to another, from the light of a window to the warmth of a fire. They were generally intended for women and were suited to a variety of purposes (image 4).
​​<br><br>
One such purpose was letter writing, a fashionable pastime among French upper-class women during the 1700s. Letters, either in the possession of young women or discreetly exchanged between presumed lovers, often appear in paintings of the time as suggestions of sexual intrigue (image 5).
