    description:    "The porcelain plaques that decorate this stand were likely sold by the Sèvres porcelain factory to the dealers Simon-Philippe Poirier and Dominique Daguerre, who then specially commissioned this piece from the cabinetmaker Martin Carlin. Poirier and Daguerre are credited with the creation of many novel forms of porcelain-mounted furniture in the 1700s.
