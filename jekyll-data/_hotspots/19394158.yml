    description:    "The design of this clock was likely conceived by the Parisian dealer Simon-Philippe Poirier who, along with his partner Dominique Daguerre, would have commissioned its various components from a number of sources, including the Sèvres porcelain factory. The gilded bronze figures of a partially draped female holding two hearts, a child, and a dog are meant to represent an allegory of love and friendship.
