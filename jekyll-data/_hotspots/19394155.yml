    description:    "Gui Crescent Fagon (1638–1718) was Louis XIV’s chief doctor and director of the king’s botanical gardens. Celebrated in his own lifetime, he gave medical advice to the king and court and encouraged scientific botanical studies through the collection of plants from abroad. The potted aloe plant that sits on the base behind him is a reference to his botanical interests.

This realistically conceived figure was among the earliest produced at the Sèvres factory of a known personality. It is a bit puzzling, however, why Sèvres produced a likeness of the doctor in the 1770s some five decades after his death. Madame Adélaïde, daughter of Louis XV, is recorded has having purchased one of these figures from the factory on January 27, 1776.
