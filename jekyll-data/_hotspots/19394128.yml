    description:    "These wall lights are two of eight delivered in August 1784 to Mesdames Victoire, Adélaïde, and Sophie, the elderly spinster aunts of King Louis XVI (image 2). They were made for the Grand Salon of the château at Bellevue. Located between Paris and Versailles, the château was originally built in 1748 by King Louis XV for his mistress, Madame de Pompadour. After Pompadour’s death in 1764 Louis XV sold the château to his sisters (image 3).
<br><br>
These lights were among numerous furnishings supplied to the sisters by the Parisian dealers Darnault, Frères. The dealers commissioned Feuchère to produce these gilded bronzes and contracted with cabinetmaker Martin Carlin to create the furniture—all of the highest quality and latest fashion. Ten of the Carlin pieces are today in the Louvre Museum in Paris (image 4).
<br><br>
Gilded bronze, whether in the form of an object like these wall lights or made to decorate a piece of furniture, was an essential element in the sumptuous French interiors of the 1700s. Not only did this luxurious material speak to the wealth of the owner, but its gleaming surface—like the mirrors that often lined such rooms—reflected candle- and firelight (image 5).
