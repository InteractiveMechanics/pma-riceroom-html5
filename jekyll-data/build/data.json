With the design in hand, workers in Baumhauer’s shop constructed the carcass and covered the exposed surfaces, except for the desktop, with a thin layer of tulipwood veneer.

                "description": "In 1664 Jean-Baptiste Colbert, King Louis XIV’s minister in charge of buildings, began a campaign initiated by the king (image 2) to transform the Louvre (the royal residence at the time) into the grandest and largest palace in Europe. Central to this project was the renovation of a 1,450-foot-long space known as the Grande Galerie. This amazing interior overlooked the Seine and connected the Louvre and Tuileries palaces (image 3). <br /><br /> For this hall Colbert commissioned the Savonnerie carpet factory to produce ninety-three carpets. The commission’s scale was unprecedented in the history of French woven arts, and the carpets that were ultimately produced rank among the greatest artistic achievements of the 1600s. <br /><br /> Production of the carpets, which were each some thirty feet in length and required the construction of new looms made from particularly long and stout tree trunks (image 4), began in 1668 and continued until 1688, by which time the king had lost interest in the project and moved the court to Versailles. In the following centuries the carpets were given away as diplomatic gifts or, on special occasions, brought out of storage for use at the royal residences and elsewhere. <br /><br /> In 1788 the Museum’s carpet was sent <em>for one day</em> to the Paris church of Saint-Roch for the marriage of the Duke de Montmorency. And on June 18, 1919, when the treaty that ended World War I was signed at Versailles, twenty-four of the carpets adorned the Galerie des Glaces (Hall of Mirrors) (image 5). <br /><br /> Although each of the Savonnerie carpets is individual in design, they share certain distinct traits: a black background, a modified egg-and-leaf border, scrolling acanthus leaves in the corners, and cartouches at each end that contain either a landscape or allegorical scene. All display decorations replete with royal emblems. The design of the Museum’s carpet includes the crowned monogram of the king four times in the center and a crowned globe with the motto NEC PLURIBUS IMPAR (One Among Many) at each end. <br /><br /> 1668–85<br /> Wool, linen <br /><br /> After a model made by <strong>Charles Le Brun</strong>, French, born 1619, died 1690; or <strong>Louis Le Vau</strong>, French, born 1612, died 1670 <br /><br /> Made by the <strong>Savonnerie carpet manufactory</strong>, Paris, 1627–1825 <br /><br /> Bequest of Eleanore Elkins Rice, 1939-41-27",

They were made for the Grand Salon of the château at Bellevue. Located between Paris and Versailles, the château was originally built in 1748 by King Louis XV for his mistress, Madame de Pompadour. After Pompadour’s death in 1764 Louis XV sold the château to his sisters (image 3). <br /><br /> These lights were among numerous furnishings supplied to the sisters by the Parisian dealers Darnault, Frères. The dealers commissioned Feuchère to produce these gilded bronzes and contracted with cabinetmaker Martin Carlin to create the furniture—all of the highest quality and latest fashion. Ten of the Carlin pieces are today in the Louvre Museum in Paris (image 4). <br /><br /> Gilded bronze, whether in the form of an object like these wall lights or made to decorate a piece of furniture, was an essential element in the sumptuous French interiors of the 1700s. Not only did this luxurious material speak to the wealth of the owner, but its gleaming surface—like the mirrors that often lined such rooms—reflected candle- and firelight (image 5). <br /><br /> 1784<br /> Gilded bronze <br /><br /> Made by <strong>Pierre-François Feuchère</strong>, French, born 1737, died 1823 <br /><br /> Bequest of Eleanore Elkins Rice, 1939-41-28a,b",

Celebrated in his own lifetime, he gave medical advice to the king and court and encouraged scientific botanical studies through the collection of plants from abroad. The potted aloe plant that sits on the base behind him is a reference to his botanical interests. <br /><br /> This realistically conceived figure was among the earliest produced at the Sèvres factory of a known personality. It is a bit puzzling, however, why Sèvres produced a likeness of the doctor in the 1770s some five decades after his death. Madame Adélaïde, daughter of King Louis XV, is recorded has having purchased one of these figures from the factory on January 27, 1776. <br /><br /> c. 1774<br /> Hard-paste porcelain with enamel and gilt decoration; wood walking stick <br /><br /> Original model possibly made by <strong>Josse-François-Joseph Le Riche</strong>, Belgian, born 1741, died 1812 <br /><br /> Made by the <strong>Sèvres porcelain factory</strong>, Sèvres, France, 1756–present <br /><br /> Gilded by <strong>Henri-Martin Prévost</strong>, French, active 1757 to 1797 <br /><br /> Bequest of Eleanore Elkins Rice, 1939-41-55",

                "description": "This vase, along with much of the porcelain in this room, was made at the famous Sèvres (formerly Vincennes) porcelain factory. The manufactory, purchased by French King Louis XV in 1759, produced some of the finest porcelain in Europe during the second half of the 1700s. <br /><br /> The distinctive style developed by Sèvres in the 1750s included brightly colored background colors, exquisite painted scenes, and lavish embellishments in gold. Because of a privilege granted by the king in 1745, the Sèvres factory was the only one in France permitted to decorate its porcelain with figures. <br /><br /> This vase’s turquoise blue <em>(bleu celeste)</em> ground color, only the second introduced at the factory, proved to be its most successful. First created for a dinner and dessert service made for Louis XV in the early 1750s (image 2), <em>bleu celeste</em> appeared on a variety of pieces produced during the latter half of the century. <br /><br /> Charles-Nicolas Dodin, considered one of the most skillful painters at Sèvres, decorated this vase with a scene drawn by François Boucher, a French painter, engraver, and designer (image 3). It depicts an elderly man reading the fortune of a young shepherdess, a book at his feet displaying the astrological symbol of a crescent moon and accompanied by three younger figures who frolic and flirt. Boucher’s work embodied the spirit of the times and had an unparalleled impact on the decorative arts of the 1700s. <br /><br /> 1764<br /> Soft-paste porcelain with enamel and gilt decoration <br /><br /> Model probably made by <strong>Jean-Claude Duplessis, Sr.</strong>, French, born c. 1695, died 1774 <br /><br /> Made by the <strong>Sèvres porcelain factory</strong>, Sèvres, France, 1756–present <br /><br /> Decorated by <strong>Charles-Nicolas Dodin</strong>, French, born 1734, died 1803 <br /><br /> Bequest of Eleanore Elkins Rice, 1939-41-61",

They were generally intended for women and were suited to a variety of purposes (image 4). ​​<br /><br /> One such purpose was letter writing, a fashionable pastime among French upper-class women during the 1700s.
