                "description": "These exquisitely painted and lavishly gilded potpourri vases exemplify the production of the Sevres porcelain factory, the preeminent European manufactory in the second half of the eighteenth century. The quintessentially sinuous rococo shape was designed by Jean-Claude Duplessis, a sculptor who had been trained as a goldsmith and who was the head of the modeling workshop at Sevres. The intricately painted scenes within reserves are after two paintings entitled Rendez-vous de chasse and Depart pour Ia chasse by Carel van Falens, a Flemish-born painter who worked in Paris. The use of the scenes after van Falens' paintings reflects not only the popularity of hunting among France's aristocracy, many of whom were customers of Sevres, but also the fashion among French collectors for Dutch and Flemish paintings particularly of the seventeenth century. The reserves on the reverse of the potpourri vases are painted with naturally rendered floral bouquets. The potpourris would have stood on a chest or table placed against a wall under a mirror in which the floral decoration would have been reflected.",
